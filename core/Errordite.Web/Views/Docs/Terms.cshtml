        <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
        <h2>Agreement</h2>
        <p>By using Errordite, you agree to be bound by these terms of use.</p>
        <h2>Description of Service</h2>
        <p>Errordite receives errors you send from your application, whether using one of the linked-to client providers or 
            by sending JSON in the documented format.  If the token matches the token of an active application in your organisation
            the error will be stored against that application. If the error matches an existing issue, according to the current set
            of rules at the time the error is received by Errordite, the error will be attached to this matching issue.  If the error
            does not match any existing issues, according to the rules defined at the time the error is received, a new issue will be 
            created and the error will be attached to this new issue.  Your organisation's users can subsequently modify the issues, 
            which may result in errors becoming attached to other issues.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once the maximum number of errors that can be attached to a single issue has been reached against a single issue, older errors 
            will become deleted from this issue upon new matching errors arriving.  The number of issues, applications, errors permitted in total
            is controlled by your plan.  If a large number of errors are received by Errordite in a short space of time, some errors may be dropped
            by our throttling algorithm.  The precise level of all the aforementioned limits is at our discretion and may change at any time.
        </p>
        <p>We make no guarantees about the recording of any information you may send to Errordite.</p>
